# 🌀 Warp Terminal Setup

To get the same "cool" glassmorphism look in Warp:

## 1. Apply the Theme
1. Open Warp and go to `Settings > Appearance`.
2. Click on the **Current theme** box.
3. Select **CatppuccinMocha** (which I've just installed for you).

## 2. Enable Transparency & Blur
1. In `Settings > Appearance`, scroll down to the **Themes** section.
2. Find the **Window Opacity** slider. Move it to about **85%**.
3. Once opacity is below 100%, the **Blur radius** slider will activate. Set it to around **20**.

## 3. Font Setup
1. In `Settings > Appearance`, find the **Text** section.
2. Set your font to **JetBrainsMono Nerd Font** (or your preferred Nerd Font).

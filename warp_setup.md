# 🌀 Warp Terminal Setup

To get the same "cool" glassmorphism look in Warp:

## 1. Apply the Theme
1. Open Warp and go to `Settings > Appearance`.
2. Click on the **Current theme** box.
3. Select **CatppuccinMocha** (which I've just installed for you).

## 2. Enable Transparency & Blur
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Transparency in Warp is controlled by a slider in the UI, not by the theme file itself.
1. In `Settings > Appearance`, scroll down to the **Themes** section.
2. Find the **Window Opacity** slider. Move it to about **85%**.
3. Once opacity is below 100%, the **Blur radius** slider will activate. Set it to around **20**.

- **MacOS Theme**: Ensure your macOS is set to "Dark" or "Auto" in System Settings, as this can sometimes affect how translucent windows render.
- **Check for Updates**: Go to `Settings > Accounts` and click **Check for Update**. Older versions of Warp had more bugs with transparency.
- **Opacity Slider Location**: Ensure you are looking at `Settings > Appearance > Themes` (or Window). If the slider is at 100, it's fully opaque. Move it to 85.

## 4. Font Setup
1. In `Settings > Appearance`, find the **Text** section.
2. Set your font to **JetBrainsMono Nerd Font** (or your preferred Nerd Font).
